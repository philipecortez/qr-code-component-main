## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Imported fonts from google fonts
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learned how to import fonts from google fonts and also how to use figure and figcaption tags


```html
<article>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr-code">
    <h3>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h3>
    <figcaption>
      Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</article>
```

Font import
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap');
```

### Continued development

It was cool to use flexbox do center the element on the screen I think I need more practice on this topic because it would be great to know more about it
